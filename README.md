# CleanMunch
In Scotland, restaurants are mandated by law to display their food hygiene rating. However, this is not the case in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Therefore, I made CleanMunch to help UK foodies eat at their favourite restaurants with a peace of mind knowing it has a good hygiene rating. Through the app users can check nearby restaurants for their 0-5 hygiene score. You can even search by restaurant name. 

Eat with confidence, find the cleanest restaurant, and force the industry to clean up its act!

Scores as seen in screenshot are correct as of 22/03/2019 but may have changed since. Please use the CleanMunch app or ratings.food.gov.uk for the latest hygiene ratings.
